      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>So how does this work?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Every week on Wednesday people show up and ride bikes. There are
            regulars, but there's no real leader and people come and go. It's
            the same route every week so people treat it rather flexibly, some
            showing up at stops, or riding the route in reverse until they run
            into folks.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're interested in joining up, give a shout, and someone will
            make sure to get you synced up with others on the ride!
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What's the usual turn out?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            5-25, average of 10. Even if there is rain, a few folks usually show up.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What kinda ride is this?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Rather relaxed. Most folks show up in work attire. Sometimes, a few in
            lycra. The first three stops are usually long enough to drink a beer.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>How fast do people go?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            It's not a super speedy group ride. Faster than Bike Party or Critical
            Mass, but it's still a no drop, everyone is welcome ride.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What kinda bike should I bring?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Whatever you got! Butter is doable on just about any bike, though gears
            are recommended. It's all paved, though there are a few options for some
            hard packed trails if that's your thing.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What else should I bring?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A jacket and some lights are pretty important. Many people bring
            beers or snacks to share as well.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What time does this ride end?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Usually folks hit the Panhandle at 9:45-10:15. Bender's about 15-30 minutes
            after that.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>But Benders is closed right now?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            And we're very sad about it. In the mean time some have decided that
            <a href="https://eattopround.com/san-francisco">Top Round</a> in The
            Mission is both open late, and good to stop by after. Others just go
            up Twin Peaks and then home.
